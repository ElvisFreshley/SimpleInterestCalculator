Simple Interest Calculator<br>
This is my first time using GitHub.<br>
Let's see how well this ages. <br>
I'll compare my coding skills to this calculator in a year and revisit it yearly for that reason. <br>


A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r
